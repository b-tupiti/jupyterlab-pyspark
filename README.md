A containerized environment for running a jupyter notebook (using jupyter lab, because why not) and pyspark.
The base image used here is from [apache spark](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/spark/tags)'s docker registry.

Efforts to be make this setup a bit more optimized has been skewed due to coffee shortage.
